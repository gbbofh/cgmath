# CGMATH
## Introduction
A simple library intended for use with OpenGL, written in C. This library provides decent support for
several data structures that act as analogues to those found in the GL Shading Language. Namely, this
includes:
* vec2f - a 2D vector
* vec3f - a 3D vector
* vec4f - a 4D vector
* mat2f - a 2x2 matrix
* mat3f - a 3x3 matrix
* mat4f - a 4x4 matrix

There is a lot of room for improvement in this library, and I doubt it is particularly efficient. But it was
a very fun exercise to see what I could produce in 48 hours. If you use this in any projects (for whatever reason),
please feel free to shoot me an email showcasing your project!

## TODO
I would like to see basic support for unit quaternions (for rotation) added, but currently lack the time to do this.
Additionally, the code could probably be reduced in size by using some loops and whatnot. This was mostly just an exercise
in seeing what I can produce in a relatively short (48 hour) timespan.
